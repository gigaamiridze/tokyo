                       had previously fastened together, and passing one end to the topmost warrior I lowered the other
                       end cautiously over the opposite side of the wall toward the avenue below. No one was in sight,
                       so, lowering myself to the end of my leather strap, I dropped the remaining thirty feet to the
                       pavement below.

                       topmost man. Then starting from a short distance behind them I ran swiftly up from one tier to the
                       next, and with a final bound from the broad shoulders of the highest I clutched the top of the great
                       wall and quietly drew myself to its broad expanse. After me I dragged six lengths of leather from an
                       equal number of my warriors.

                       either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken out
                       while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very
                       peaceful and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse 
                       had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.
